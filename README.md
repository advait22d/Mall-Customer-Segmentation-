# Mall-Customer-Segmentation-
Hi, This project is for identifying and analysing the customers visiting a mall. This project aims at understanding patterns of the customer behaviour and split the customers into groups. I will be using the Kmeans Algorithm to form customer segments based on their annual salary and spendings in the mall. This Project can be really useful for identifying various types of customers. Companies can look at the customer pool and target specific customers based on thier spending habits.
