# Mall-Customer-Segmentation-
Hi, This project is for identifying and analysing the customers visiting a mall. This project aims at understanding patterns of the customer behaviour and split the customers into groups. I will be using the Kmeans Algorithm to form customer segments based on their annual salary and spendings in the mall.
